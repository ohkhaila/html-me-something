                    <p>Juanetta was happy to be back at the butterfly house and apparently the butterflies were happy to see her too. 
                        As soon as she stepped foot into the sanctuary she was greeted by a beautiful monarch. He flew right up to her
                        and landed on the corner of her glasses. He sat there for half a second before he circled around her and found a better
                        seat on her shoulder. "Ahh, that must be William." the guide said with a smile. "He's the most friendly butterfly we have. He 
                        greets the gentlest spirits that come into the sanctuary. You should be honored." Juanetta smiled and replied, "Well, of course
                        I am. Thank you WIlliam for allowing me to visit your home."
