                        Three years ago a friend of mine posted a Facebook status.
                        <b> &quot;Who wants to get paid to learn how to code?&quot;</b>
                        I messaged him telling him that I had a friend who would be the perfect candidate for the program. This friend, we'll call him Tea, was super eager to learn and ready to go at the drop of the dime. 
                        Before I knew it my friend, we'll call him Coffee from now on, added me to an email with the CEO of the company that was running the program. I panicked. He thought that I wanted to learn how to code. And I kind of did
                        but Tea was way more pumped about it than I was so I wasn't going to take their spot. Well Coffee wasn't letting me back out. He told me he knew that I could do it and he thought that I had the potential to work the company past the bounds of the program. 
                        I agreed to try to get in, I went through the application process and was accepted. I spent the summer of 2017 learning the basics of full stack development from the CEO of a startup in STL. I struggled. It was one of the hardest things I've done and at the end of it I was asked to teach the next cohort.

                <h2>Fast Forward to the Present.</h2>
                    <p>
                     Now I'm in LaunchCode on the track to becoming a full time web developer. It's still a little crazy to say. I studied education in college. I love children, I love books, I love making a difference in the lives that matter the most.
                     I don't love being a part of an oppressive system that targets black and brown children, I don't love being paid unfairly, and I don't love feeling drained. I decided to switch my career before stepping my foot fully into the door. I got a taste of what my life would be like
                     and chose to bet on myself. I love to learn. I like to be challenged. I like to build things and help people. I really like to feel needed. Expanding my skillset is one of my favorite things to do.</br>
                     Becoming a developer is exciting for me because it is a step towards liberation. It's a step towards autonomy over my own life. It's a piece of the puzzle that I get to shape into whatever I want it to be. It's a chance for me to
                     bring my dream life to reality.</br>
                     I'm often the main person complaining about the setup or flow of a website. I want things to be easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. Hence, my decision to take the front end track of LC101. 
                     I understand that everything has it's challenges and I like that front end development often shows you exactly how wrong your code is. 
                     My present moment is dedicated to developing myself professionally and balancing myself physically, mentally, and spiritually. I'm manifesting the life that I want in thought, speech, and action.

                <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
                    <p>Money isn't everything unless you don't have it. It's a tool that can be used to gain access to many things in life as we know it. And with it I can lay some issues to rest and create space to process the issues that are often pushed to the back burner
                        in order to survive. Aside from the ability to accumulate wealth, developers are needed virtually everywhere. And I am trying to see the world, okay? And I'm not just talking vacation. I want to live in new places and experience new things. I'd prefer to do this with a strong stream of income.</br>
                        In the future I will be a talented front end developer with great communication skills. I will build beautiful, accessible applications.
